- The header is NOT readable:
-- Having the **third** version of the every type of options ("documenting...")
   makes reading even worse. Absolutely unclear *why* the reader should treat
   the excluded code as an actual code. Not clear how it is supposed to work.
   I hardly believe that many readers will just blindly follow disabled part
   of the header. In practice it would be the opposite: many readers just
   ignore disabled parts of the headers (as IDEs gray-out or even hide them).
-- IDEs will be cryptic as well when decoding hierarchical macros (the options
   itself, then macros that set the options).
-- IDEs will not point to "generated ... documenting", when one would try
   to follow the definition/declaration
-- Trying to "grep" for the keyword (as previously suggested way to find the
   declaration) is giving too many false results. This makes understanding
   even more complicated and even less straightforward.
-- '#include "microhttpd2_generated_daemon_options.h"' is far from "generated
    code documenting..."
-- All macros that switching from "static inline" to macros with compound
   literals are not clear for the user. Even right now it is not clear how
   they are supposed to work. Not clear that one form is used for C compilers,
   while another form is used for C++ compilers (and, actually, the third
   possible version, for not compatible compilers, for C89, and before C++11
   however it is not the largest concern). It is not clear that app code is
   supposed to look the same in both C and C++. Actually, even with modern
   compilers (and language version) there are three possible combinations:
   - macros for option with macro to make an array (C),
   - static functions for options with macro to make an array (C++ with clang),
   - static functions with vector (C++ in general).
   And this is repeated for every section with the options.
-- Functions with ALL CAPS are hard to read. ALL CAPS are usually macros.

It is supposed to make the header maintainable so someone may take care about
it later. BUT
- The header is hardly maintainable:
-- The structure of generated parts, static parts, databases and the build
   system is not obvious at all. You need to dig very deep just to understand
   now to start modifying it. It is NOT a good design.
   The worst thing that actually the current version is not good enough for
   the production. The production version has to be even more complicated,
   which makes it even less maintainable.
-- Simple question: what if it will be needed to change the formatting of
   header? Which file should I edit? Is it obvious? For example, change
   the indent.
-- Adding new type of settings (for example, for the stream) is complicated
   and multiply already large number of input files.
-- It is always not nice that relatively often modifiable file (the main
   header) cannot be modified directly. Every time when I change something
   in the main header, I have to run the build system before starting using
   the new header. This may require update of the generated makefiles or re-run
   the configure. Currently re-run of configure takes 6 minutes on W32. 
   With the additional checks for build host compilers (and other new checks)
   it will be even longer. So, more then 6 minutes after edit of some part
   of the header before getting the result. No efficient at all!

- The build system for the header is broken currently.
-- Need to add the section to the configure for the build compilers, document
   additional parameters, pass them correctly to makefiles, make custom build
   rules for binaries for build host (libtool cannot be used), make everything
   similar to rules for target host
-- Need to fix makefiles for out-of-tree builds
-- Need to fix makefiles for parallel builds (this is not easy! check the "po"
   part)
-- Need to fix the generator itself. Currently it is not POSIX, using
   unportable extensions. Need to make it with proper memory handling and
   correct checking for all errors. "It works fast" will not be an excuse for
   security audits. It sounds like "I'll commit a crime, but I'll do it very
   quickly, so it will not be a crime". Memory leaks are not acceptable for
   proper design, even on developers machines.
   I expect also many reports from users that use any kind of "sanitizers" or
   analysers that immaculately report tons of problems.
   In short: we cannot afford this code in our repo.
-- More inputs requires more checks to keep them in sync. More test, more
   makefile rules, more problems with "make distcheck".
-- All these fixes makes build system even more complicated, even less obvious,
   even less readable, even harder maintainable. Problems will be multiplied
   with additional types of the settings.

! Errors: struct MHD_responseOptionAndValue vs struct MHD_ResponseOptionAndValue
! Errors: struct MHD_daemonOptionAndValue vs struct MHD_DaemonOptionAndValue
! Errors: Doxy lines are too long.
! Errors: Some doxy lines are broken (do not start with " *")
! Errors: Several "@param"s are in single doxy line
! Wrong: The body of some static functions with single parameter are formed as macros

Positive:
+ The excluded "portability" macros is fine (actually, the excluded part is
  not about the portability only)
